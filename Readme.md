# msUnit

msUnit aims to be a drop-in replacement for the MSTest framework and runner provided with Visual Studio with the intention of allowing MSTest assemblies to run on other OSs.
It uses a modified version of the nUnit framework to replace microsoft.visualstudio.qualitytools.unittestframework and a new test runner.
